# OpsWithNumbers

A simple project that allows to perform basic arithmetic operations with numbers in different bases (up to base 16)

I developed this project when I was taking the course on computer organization to help me better understand the algorithms that we used when performing those operations by hand, so this is obviously not the most efficient solution
